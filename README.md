# GolfPS-iOS
Golf GPS app for iOS.

This app uses Google Firebase and Google Maps to track your game of golf. You can select from a limited list of courses, update your bag of clubs to their average distances, and even link your SnapChat bitmoji character to represent your location on the course.

The course data is loaded onto the Google Firestore using a separate Java tool. The course data includes tee, bunker, and pin locations for each hole on the course.

Future improvements will include:
 - Keeping and sharing score
 - Socialization with golfers on the same course
 - Apple Watch integration

Feel free to message me to be added to the beta test list.
